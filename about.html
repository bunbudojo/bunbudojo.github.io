            <h1>About Bunbo Dojo</h1>
            <p>Bunbu Dojo is West Bridgford’s largest martial arts school.</p>
<p>The majority of students are children, with the current range of ages being from five to fourteen, though we also have adult classes (those aged fourteen-plus normally train in the adult class).</p>

</p>
<p>Classes run five days a week, at three venues in West Bridgford.</p>
<p>Prospective students are welcome to come and join in for a couple of classes to see what it’s all about. If you’d like more information before coming to a class, please call or email.</p>
<p>We like to support our students and the local community, through re-investment of funds back into the club, extra training where required at no charge, instructor training for keen students, and community work by the students to encourage their personal growth.</p>
