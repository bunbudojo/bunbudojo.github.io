<p>The Japanese concept of ‘Kangeiko’ (literally, coldest time of the year training) seeks to bring together the coldness of the weather with martial training/spirit.</p>

</p>
<p>Trying to communicate this through to our members we add our own unique twist to help make our members well-rounded individuals.</p>
<p>The message is simple: The small sacrifice of a warm bed, house and early 7am meet in the park allows us to at least empathise in a small way with those who may not enjoy the luxuries we take for granted. The running and training for an hour allows us to align with the traditional Kangeiko.</p>
<p>Last year we used our last day for a well needed food drop for charity. This year we reach out to our community and donate cooked goods, thanks to a 9 year old member’s initiative. (More to follow on this)</p>
<p>The Bunbu Dojo Karate School is once again proud to be a different type of commercial sports school: One to which its members can contribute and one in which they can develop positive moral values.</p>
