<p>As we start 2014, I think back to when we first began our ‘small’ karate school. A room 5×5 metres and 3 children, which has grown into what we have today.</p>
<p>I would like to start the new year with our new year appointments and staff structure of the karate school:</p>
<p>James, Rik and Jane will be heading up the teaching staff with Jane appointed to children’s chief instructor, Rik taking care of the school’s development and James developing the curriculum.</p>
<p>Our newly appointed black belts, Amelie, Angela and Paul will assist in the lessons. Also, Angela will provide input into the school’s technical development, Amelie will be the school’s Captain and Paul will develop fitness.</p>
<p>Our students will fall into one of the four Bunbu Dojo houses:</p>
<p>Storm: Captain Finlay Wishart, Vice Captain Sam Bayes</p>
<p>Water: Captain Liam Horne</p>
<p>Fire: Henry Vervoorts, Vice Captain Louis Cooke</p>
<p>Earth: Jamie Barker, Vice Captain Finlay Strang</p>
<p>Our Cycle 1 Squad will have the following captains:</p>
<p>Girls: Jane Jackson, Vice Captain Rhiannon Lewis</p>
<p>Boys: Liam Horne, Vice Captain Antonio Pero</p>
<p>Finally we are pleased to announce our trainee instructors:</p>
<p>Liam Horne Antonio Pero Billie Hoy</p>
<p>Candidates: Sam Bayes Rhiannon Lewis Max Hoy (P/T)</p>
