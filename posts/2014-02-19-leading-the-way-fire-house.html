<p>The ‘house system’ of the school allows children to further develop team working and collaboration skills.</p>
<p>Children are left to manage and develop their houses with minimal intervention as long as they fulfil the criteria of benefit to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Member</li>
<li>School</li>
<li>Wider community</li>
</ul>
<p>House Fire, Captained by Henry and Louis, orchestrated a cake bake to donate to the Friary drop-in centre within their community.</p>

</p>
<p>Hundreds of cakes cooked by the members found their way to the food kitchens to be distributed to vulnerable adults.</p>
<p>The instructors would like to thank Henry, Louis and members of House Fire for initiative and a great event to end our Kangeiko.</p>
