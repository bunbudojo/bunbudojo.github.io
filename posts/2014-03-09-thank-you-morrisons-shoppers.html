<p>For those who have generously donated money today thank you!</p>
<p>I would like to assure you that your money is 100% being used to benefit the children who have kindly given up their Sunday to help pack your bag and meet you.</p>
<p>The Bunbu Dojo Karate is school is an extremely large school serving the community of West Bridgford and Lady Bay. We are also a relatively a new school and lacking in the resources to match our ambition and time frame. The expenses of competition, equipment and mats are too much for our school to fund without the help of your generosity or support. Training our squad requires hundreds of pounds in hall hire, petrol for transport and equipment to practice with.</p>
<p>Gum shields, approved competition equipment, and 64 mats to practice on runs into the thousands before we even face an opponent, so every penny helps us.</p>

<p>We are very proud of our members and we hope that you were impressed by the motivation, focus and determination of our future champions when you met them today.</p>
